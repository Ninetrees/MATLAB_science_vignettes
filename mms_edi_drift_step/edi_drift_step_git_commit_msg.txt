edi_drift_step v02.02.00
~ edi_drift_step_app_rot_mat_unc: replace sum() with element-wise addition.
~ Prepare uncertainty plots with log y for comparison.
~ Add d_CI_bpp_gt_0p5 logic to plot poor stat cases
~ Change unc calcs using the drift step d, from frunc to unc,
  because there is a scaling problem related to the drift step grid origin
  as the center of the obs. Consider a SD of 0.1 @ 1 m and @ 0.1 m, and see
  the effect on frunc; frunc blows up as d ~> 0.0.
  The plain math is, for some q = x*y, the worst unc for q is
  x*SDy + y*SDx + SDx*SDy.
  See updated 'Accuracy, Error, Precision, and Uncertainty.txt'.
  Fruncs should not be used for any quantity that spans the real numbers,
  because fractional values don't make sense for values that approach zero
  from + or -. Speed, for example, can use frunc, but velocity should not.
~ Update EDI_beams_and_virtual_source_demo_0200.m
  Move and rotate observatory based on gyroPeriod, spinPeriod, and obs speed
